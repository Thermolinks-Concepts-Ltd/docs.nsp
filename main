## Missing User Portal

### Critical Gap Analysis

The NSP ecosystem is currently missing its **user-facing portal component**, which represents a significant gap in the complete solution. While the backend API (nsp-api) and admin dashboard (nsp-admin) are fully implemented, users currently have no way to:

### Missing User Functionality
‚ùå **User Registration**: No interface for entities to register  
‚ùå **Application Submission**: No way to submit labelling applications  
‚ùå **Profile Management**: No user-facing profile editing  
‚ùå **Document Upload**: No interface for required document submission  
‚ùå **Status Tracking**: No way to track application progress  
‚ùå **Program Discovery**: No interface to browse available programs  
‚ùå **Forum Participation**: No user interface for community discussions  
‚ùå **Article Reading**: No platform for consuming content  
‚ùå **Support Requests**: No user-friendly ticket submission  

### Impact on User Experience
- **Registration Bottleneck**: Users cannot self-register, requiring manual admin creation
- **Application Delays**: Applications must be submitted through admin interface
- **Poor User Engagement**: No direct user interaction with the platform
- **Support Overhead**: All user actions require admin intervention
- **Limited Adoption**: Barrier to entry prevents ecosystem growth

### Required User Portal Features

#### 1. User Registration & Onboarding
- Multi-step registration forms for each entity type
- Email and phone verification workflows
- Profile completion guidance
- Welcome tutorials and orientation

#### 2. Dashboard & Profile Management
- Personalized user dashboard
- Profile editing and management
- Company information updates
- Document management interface

#### 3. Application Management
- Application submission interfaces
- Document upload with progress tracking
- Application status monitoring
- Resubmission capabilities for returned applications

#### 4. Program Discovery & Registration
- Browse available programs
- Filter by industry, type, and location
- Program registration and tracking
- Calendar integration for important dates

#### 5. Community Features
- Forum participation interface
- Article reading and commenting
- User connections and networking
- Event notifications and updates

#### 6. Support & Communication
- Support ticket creation and tracking
- Message center for admin communications
- Notification management
- Help documentation and FAQs

### Technical Requirements for User Portal

#### Recommended Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 (consistency with admin dashboard)
- **UI Library**: Material-UI v5 (shared component library)
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js with JWT integration
- **State Management**: Zustand + React Query
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with validation
- **File Upload**: React Dropzone with progress tracking

#### Integration Requirements
- **API Integration**: Full integration with existing nsp-api endpoints
- **Shared Authentication**: JWT token compatibility with admin dashboard
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach for accessibility
- **Performance**: Optimized for users with varying internet speeds

#### Development Priority
1. **Phase 1**: Core registration and profile management
2. **Phase 2**: Application submission and tracking
3. **Phase 3**: Program discovery and community features
4. **Phase 4**: Advanced features and optimizations

### Immediate Action Required
The missing user portal represents a **critical blocker** for the NSP ecosystem launch. Without it, the platform cannot serve its intended purpose of facilitating Nigeria's startup ecosystem according to the Startup Act.

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. **Assess existing user portal code** (if available in different repository)
2. **Plan user portal development** with phased approach
3. **Establish shared component library** between admin and user interfaces
4. **Implement user authentication flow** compatible with existing backend
5. **Develop core user registration and application workflows**
